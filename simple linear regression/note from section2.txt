Regression Models 
help to predict some continuos real numbers {eg. salary, interest rates, stock prices...etc}

the predict function only takes 2D arrays in case you want to enter one number write [[number]] and it 
will work;

with the dataset used in the model, we got very close results because that the dataset dependent vars
and independent vars have linear corelation if the dataset doest not have linear corelation then we
can not use linear regression to model it.
